        "description": "Modify the tax calculation logic for multi-family housing to correctly apply building ownership percentage, fix the calculation when ownership is 0%, and improve the display format of calculation process.",
        "details": "This task involves updating the regional resource facility tax calculation logic for multi-family housing in the `src/utils/mainTaxCalculation.ts` file. The current implementation has several issues:\n\n1. When building ownership percentage is 0%, the tax is incorrectly calculated as 3,720 won instead of 0 won.\n2. The current reverse calculation approach produces incorrect results.\n\nImplementation steps:\n1. Locate the multi-family housing regional resource facility tax calculation section in `src/utils/mainTaxCalculation.ts`.\n2. Modify the calculation logic to directly apply the building ownership percentage to the tax standard of each district.\n3. Add a condition to check if the building ownership percentage is 0%, and if so, set the tax amount to 0 won.\n4. Update the calculation process display format according to user requirements.\n\nCode changes should follow this approach:\n```typescript\n// Example implementation (adjust based on actual code structure)\nfunction calculateRegionalResourceFacilityTax(buildingOwnershipPercentage: number, taxStandard: number): number {\n  // Return 0 if ownership percentage is 0\n  if (buildingOwnershipPercentage === 0) {\n    return 0;\n  }\n  \n  // Apply ownership percentage directly to tax standard\n  const adjustedTaxStandard = taxStandard * (buildingOwnershipPercentage / 100);\n  \n  // Calculate tax based on adjusted standard\n  // ... calculation logic ...\n  \n  return calculatedTax;\n}\n```\n\nEnsure the calculation process display format meets user requirements by clearly showing:\n- The tax standard amount\n- The building ownership percentage being applied\n- The calculation steps\n- The final tax amount",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit Testing:\n   - Create unit tests for the updated calculation function with various scenarios:\n     - Test with building ownership percentage of 0% (should return 0 won)\n     - Test with building ownership percentage of 50%\n     - Test with building ownership percentage of 100%\n     - Test with various tax standard amounts\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Verify the calculation works correctly when integrated with the rest of the application\n   - Test the calculation with real district tax standard data\n\n3. Manual Testing:\n   - Create a test case with building ownership percentage set to 0% and verify the displayed tax amount is 0 won\n   - Create test cases with various ownership percentages and verify the calculation results match expected values\n   - Verify the calculation process display format meets user requirements\n\n4. Regression Testing:\n   - Ensure other tax calculations are not affected by these changes\n   - Verify the application functions correctly with the updated calculation logic\n\n5. Documentation:\n   - Document the changes made to the calculation logic\n   - Update any relevant documentation about the tax calculation process",
